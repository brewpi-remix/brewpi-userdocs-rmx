User Documentation
========================================
This documentation is written in reStructured text format and is part of the `BrewPi Remix Project
<https://www.brewpiremix.com/>`_.  If you see something that could use some updating, please let me know. Even better: Fix it yourself and send me a pull request on GitHub.

This documentation is intended for the beginner, who has to find a teenager just to change his or her wallpaper.  It should also contain ample "just the facts" information for more experienced users.  A deficiency in the documentation (i.e. if you get lost) is considered a bug, and you should bring it to my attention.
