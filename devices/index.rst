Configuring your Devices
========================
Since BrewPi 0.2, the hardware setup is dynamic and flexible: you can install and uninstall hardware from the web interface. This is all done from the `Device Configuration` tab in the web interface. From the device manager you can assign hardware (temp sensors, SSRs, etc.) to functions.

Your Devices After Programming
-----------------------------------
If you have just uploaded a HEX file to your Arduino and the EEPROM was reset, no devices are installed by default.

Receiving the Device List
-------------------------
Even with no devices configured, you must first click `Refresh device list` to receive an updated list of installed and detected devices an slots from the Arduino. To be able to receive the device list, the BrewPi script has to be running.

Detected Devices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The detected devices list shows all devices that are automatically discovered by BrewPi, these include:
 * All OneWire devices (temperature sensors and DS2413 OneWire switches)
 * All pins for which there is an assigned terminal on your shield

Installed Devices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All devices that are assigned to a function are found under `Installed devices`.

Device Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each device has the following properties:

==========================  =====
Device setting/property     What it does
==========================  =====
**Device slot**             A device is installed into a device slot. This is a unique number used to identify the device. When configuring your devices, make sure there are no 2 devices with the same slot.
**Assigned to (chamber)**   Each device is assigned to a Chamber. Currently there is only Chamber 1, but we are preparing for future multi-chamber support. Select `Chamber 1` for all your devices.
**Assigned to (beer)**      In each chamber, each device is either a `Chamber device` or assigned to a beer. Currently all supported devices are chamber devices, except for the beer temperature sensor which should be assigned to `Beer 1`.
**Function**                This is the most important setting for your device. Here you can set what the device should do. The function list is automatically limited to functions that fit with the hardware type. Currently supported functions:
                              - **Chamber temp**: the sensor in the fridge (chamber device).
                              - **Beer temp**: the sensor in your beer (beer device).
                              - **Room temp**: measures any temperature you want, but is not used in the algorithm, just for logging (chamber device).
                              - **Chamber cooler**: The output that controls your fridge compressor (chamber device).
                              - **Chamber heater**: The output that controls your heater (chamber device).
                              - **Chamber light**: This output is activated when the door is opened (see chamber door) and can also be used as heater by enabling `light as heater` in advanced settings.
                              - **Chamber door**: an input that detects when the fridge door is opened.
**Device type**             Not user configurable, set automatically based on assigned function.
**Hardware type**           Not user configurable, set automatically (`Temp Sensor`, `Digital pin` or `OneWire actuator`).
**Device type**             Not user configurable, set automatically based on assigned function.
**Pin type**                Here you can set whether the output/input should be inverted. Because the shields have a transistor that inverts the signal behind each output with a terminal, you should set this to `inverted`. For devices you add yourself, without a transistor, do not invert the signal. For the door switch, it depends on the type of switch you have.
**Arduino Pin**             The pin the device is configured for. You can only set this yourself when defining a new device. The OneWire pins are hardcoded, you can not add your own OneWire pins. Just connect your sensors to an existing OneWire pin and refresh the device list to detect it.
==========================  =====

Installing new devices and assigning them to a function
-------------------------------------------------------
You can install a device by changing the properties to a correct configuration and hitting `Apply`. If the values are accepted by the Arduino, your device will show up under `Installed Devices` after refreshing the list.

Please refer to the screenshot below for a reference configuration with all devices installed currently supported by BrewPi. Just leave out any devices you don't have.

Uninstalling a device
---------------------
To uninstall a device, just set it's function to `None`, hit `Apply` and refresh your device list.
