This repository contains the documentation for [BrewPi Remix](https://www.brewpiremix.com) which runs on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), communicating with an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction).  

These [forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) are intended for the fans of the *original* BrewPi (called "Legacy" in BrewPi circles).
